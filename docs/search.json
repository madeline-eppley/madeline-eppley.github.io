    "text": "Howdy! I’m Madeline, welcome to my website. I’m currently pursuing a PhD in Marine and Environmental Science at Northeastern University in the Lotterhos Lab.\nThis site largely contains a digital repository of my work, including lab notebooks, code and outputs, and resource lists I’ve developed. You can find out more about me on my main website and blog here.\nWhy two websites? Here, I enjoy functionality with GitHub and R markdown files that allow me to write and post code tutorials and lab protocols of relevance to the scientific community. On my personal website, I enjoy more flexible design functionality and ability to host a casual blog that make for better communication with general audiences. I prioritize both, so I have two websites!\nI made this website with Quarto and published with GitHub pages. Check out my associated GitHub repository with all associated code!"

You need a GitHub account and some intermediate familiarity with coding in R to build your own. There is no cost to host your site, and you can host it on any custom domain that you may own. I have found that design functionality is extremely limited unless you are willing to custom-develop your own styles.css documents, which is time-consuming. Importantly, you can only host one GitHub pages site per account.\nI have a tutorial on how to build your own Quarto website and host it on GitHub! Find it on my Coding page. To get started, Quarto also has a lot of information here.\n\n\nWeebly\n\n\nPros/Cons: I have used Weebly to build my personal website! I really enjoyed the ease of use and multitude of design options with Weebly. It is free to host your website with a ‘.weebly.com’ address, but you can also host on any custom domain that you may own. I purchased my custom domain through Weebly, and it was easy. There is a cost to remove banner ads at the bottom of your page, but they aren’t too distracting if you want to keep it free. No coding experience required, but it is helpful to know how to insert custom .html to embed code and links.\nYou can find my personal website on Weebly here.\n\n\nGoogle Sites\n\n\nPros/Cons: Google sites are free with a Google account and don’t require any coding experience to build! My lab has a google-hosted website that I edit regularly, and I find it easy with great version-control to use as a review process before you publish. Your site is hosted on a ‘sites.google.com/site/yourwebsitenamehere address’, or you can use any custom domain that you may own. There is decent flexibility with design and they have pre-made templates that can get you started. I have heard that some algorithms may filter google sites out of web browser search results, but have not come across this issue (potentially because I use Chrome).\n\n\nOther Hosting Options - Squarespace, Wix, WordPress\n\n\nPros/Cons: I have not built websites with any other hosting service. I have peers that have successfully used Squarespace, Wix, and WordPress with mixed reviews. Most of these hosting services will require you to pay for a plan or to remove advertisements. You may also need to purchase a custom domain, but some, like WordPress, may allow you to host for free with a ‘.wordpress.com’ address."

    "text": "Creating a Quarto Website with GitHub\nBefore getting started, you need (1) a GitHub account, (2) RStudio on your local machine, (3) GitHub desktop or Terminal, and (4) Quarto. I will complete this tutorial using GitHub Desktop, as I think it is easier to learn for those with less coding familiarity.\n\nInitializing the website\n\nIn GitHub, create a new repository with the domain name that you would like for your website. For example, my repository name is ‘madeline-eppley’, so my website will be named ‘madeline-eppley.github.io’.\nIn GitHub Desktop, choose “Add Existing Repository” and paste the clone url. Alternatively, you can open the repository in GitHub, then select “Open with GitHub Desktop”. If you’re using the terminal, you can clone the repository with gh repo clone repo-name/repo-name.github.io.\nIf this was your first time linking a repository through GitHub Desktop, by default, GitHub Desktop will create a local folder named “GitHub” in your Documents folder (on a Mac) and place your repository there. I moved this folder into my regular user space, but you can store it anywhere you like. If you’ve already set up GitHub Desktop, your new repository will be linked in the previously created folder. Locate your local repository folder.\nIn your local R Studio, initialize a new Quarto project with “New Project” and select “Quarto Website”. Then, provide the directory name as your local repository folder. You should now see a basic index.qmd and _quarto.yml file in your directory.\nOpen your _quarto.yml file and add output-dir: docs directly under the type: website line. Save the edit.\nMake a test edit to the index.qmd file and then check “Render on Save”. This will open up a locally-hosted browser where you can preview your edits. If everything looks good, you can select “Render” and will have auto-generated .html files appear in a new /docs folder within the repository folder.\nTest the setup by committing these new files to GitHub through GitHub desktop. You should then see your new setup files on GitHub.\n\n\n\nRendering the Website\n\nGo to “Settings” in GitHub and scroll down to Pages. There, select Source “Deploy from a branch” and edit the branch so that it renders from the /docs folder in the main branch. The folder that you select should be where your .html files are stored, so do NOT move your .html files out of the /docs folder.\nAt this point, GitHub will begin automatically rendering your site. Under the “Actions” tab, you can check the build and deployment status.\nWhen it completes, you can return to Settings/Pages and see that your site will be live at ‘your-repo-title.github.io’. Now you can visit your site!\n\n\n\nEditing your Website Structure\nQuarto websites are designed to host structure within the _quarto.yml file. Here, you establish your website format, image folders, style, font design, header and footer, and order of the pages. You can check out my _quarto.yml file in my repo for inspiration!\nYour index.qmd file is your first “page” and is the home screen of your website. You can add new pages at any time by adding a new .qmd file in GitHub. Each time you add a new element of “structure” (eg. a new page), you need to update the _quarto.yml file to add this file.\nI typically edit my pages locally in RStudio, but it is also possible to edit them within GitHub. Standard R markdown formatting also applies to .qmd files. Wherever you edit, be sure to use GitHub desktop or git to push and pull your edits. Whenever you’re ready to publish your new edits, you need to return to your local RStudio and “Render” your edited file. This step is important because it re-generates your .html file, which is what is actually used to build the website. To save myself the hassle of remembering this step, I enable “Render on Save” for all of my pages within RStudio.\n\n\nAdding Images to your Website\nComing soon!\n\n\nStyles, Icons, Fonts, and Colors\nComing soon!"
