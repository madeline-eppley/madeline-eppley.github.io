    "text": "Howdy! I’m Madeline, welcome to my website. I’m currently pursuing a PhD in Marine and Environmental Science at Northeastern University in the Lotterhos Lab.\nThis site largely contains a digital repository of my work, including lab notebooks, code and outputs, and resource lists I’ve developed. You can find out more about me on my main website and blog here.\nWhy two websites? Here, I enjoy functionality with GitHub and R markdown files that allow me to write code tutorials and lab protocols of relevance to the scientific community. On my personal website, I enjoy more flexible design functionality and ability to host a casual blog for better communication with general audiences. I prioritize both, so I have two websites!\nI made this website with Quarto and published with GitHub pages. Check out my associated GitHub repository with all associated code!"

    "text": "I am currently a PhD student conducting research on eastern oysters and their associated micro and macro-parasites. My lab notebook includes topics such as DNA plate extractions, DNA quantification (PicoGreen Assays, gel electrophoresis), qPCR, ImageJ, building apps, and DNA isolation from tissues preserved in FFPE material.\n\n\nI am mapping the prevalence of Polydora spp. worm blisters in eastern oyster shells to determine if populations across the range may adapt differently to parasitism. This tutorial provides basic guidance for taking high-quality images, identifying polydora worm blisters, and using ImageJ to calculate total area of infection.\n\n\n\n3-4 black beanbags, ideally with sand or small particles\nDSLR camera or digital camera with tripod attachment. An iPhone camera may work if it focuses on very close objects.\nCamera stand or tripod set-up that allows the camera to point directly down with no angle\nLevel table in a room with consistent, bright, indoor lighting - NO windows or natural light is ideal\nColor scale swatch card\nAn object of known invariable length (we use the length of a square in our color scale swatch card)\nA computer to run the freely-available ImageJ software\nA spreadsheet or app to collect data in\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVery helpful but not required materials\n\n\n\n\nA tablet or computer with touch screen and a stylus\nComputer mouse (instead of laptop trackpad)\nLarge external hard drive to store image backups. It is easy to generate several hundred images doing this protocol!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first step in the protocol is to take high-quality images of each shell. We photograph both valves together in one image. We also include a label with the ID number of the individual in the image for easy reference and a color scale card to ensure the color balance is consistent across images.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScale + Level\n\n\n\nIt’s crucial that all images of your study organism are taken at the same scale and are level. Any differences in the height of the object to the camera will translate into measurement differences in ImageJ. For this reason, use a level surface and do not vary the height of the tripod and camera. Keep all objects in the frame consistent in their distance to the camera lens across all images.\nTips: If possible, do not move the tripod setup until all imaging is complete to avoid micro-differences in camera adjustment. Use clay, beanbags, sandbags, etc. to support each object on a level plane. Do not change the height of the supportive materials (e.g. do not vary the number of beanbags).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttach camera to tripod setup. Focus the camera and take a trial image to test lighting.\nRemove the oyster shell and tag from the bag.\nStabilize the shells on top of black beanbags to ensure they sit parallel to the table and about ~5-6 inches below the camera lens.\nFocus the camera and take a few images with both shells, ID tag, and the color swatch in the frame. Make micro-adjustments in between images if necessary to ensure there is no glare on the shells.\n\n\n\nUpload the images from the camera into a folder on the computer that will use the ImageJ software.Label the folder based on population info (ID_Site_CollectionDate). Name each of the images a unique name (We use SG_XXXX_PD for seascape genomics, individual #, PolyDora).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCollecting Data\n\n\n\nWe collected our data using an app designed with AppSheet and linked to two Google Sheets - one for whole oyster measurements, and one for individual blister measurements. From this point on, if you are not using an app, record your data in whichever spreadsheet(s) you are collecting measurements in, we will refer to “app” as the data collection location.\n\n\n\nUpload the full color image of each individual into the app under the Image_valves_full_color field.\nInput TRUE or FALSE for Infection_status based on the individual. If there is at least one blister, the infection status is TRUE.\nUpload the full color image to ImageJ twice.\nConvert one of the images to 8-bit (Image-&gt;Type-&gt;8-bit) greyscale for color comparison.\nSet the measurement scale by using the linear selection tool to draw a diagonal line across a square on the color swatch. This is our scale object of known invariable length. Select “Analyze” then “set scale” and add the length of the diagonal line in the “known distance” text box and the unit in the “unit of length” text box.\n\n\n\nMeasure the area of each of the valves. Use the free draw selection tool to select the entire area of each value with the stylus, then press “m” to get the area. Enter the data into the app.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFFPE tissue blocks must be sliced thinly with a microtome prior to DNA extraction. We use a combination of histological ethanol (75-90% concentration), RNase Away, and a dry brush to clean the microtome workspace. In between samples, all slicing blades should be soaked in ethanol, and RNase Away can be sprayed onto the microtome slicing plate for additional sterilization on sharp components/hard to reach areas. The benchtop can be sterilized with histological ethanol and bleach. Every few samples, use a dry brush to swipe the excess trimmed FFPE material off of the machine and into the trash.\n\n\n\nFFPE tissue is generally stable at cool/room temperature in shaded storage cabinets. As with any preservation method, DNA in FFPE blocks will continue to degrade with time, and more rapidly under less ideal temperature and light conditions. Paraffin subjected to high heat (~120 F or greater) will melt. Research shows some trade offs between FFPE-preserved tissue DNA degradation and future ability of DNA to be amplified in qPCR/PCR based on storage temperature conditions Groelz et al 2018.\n\n\n\nI use Eppendorf LoBind 1.5 ml centrifuge tubes to reduce the extent of sample binding to the plastic tube. These tubes may also help to reduce static that makes it difficult to place sliced tissue in the tube. In the case that you are shipping FFPE samples to a clean lab space for extraction, avoid shipping during extreme high or low temperatures and opt to ship as quickly as possible (e.g. overnight, priority next-day, etc.)\n\n\n\n\nI am currently developing protocols for this, check back soon!\n\n\n\nNotes on this protocol coming soon!\n\n\nNotes on this protocol coming soon!\n\n\n\n\nNotes on these protocols coming soon!\nWe run 2% agarose gels with GelRed to visualize genomic DNA &gt;3k base pairs.

    "section": "Creating a Quarto Website with GitHub",
    "text": "Creating a Quarto Website with GitHub\nBefore getting started, you need (1) a GitHub account, (2) RStudio on your local machine, (3) GitHub desktop or Terminal, and (4) Quarto. I will complete this tutorial using GitHub Desktop, as I think it is easier to learn for those with less coding familiarity.\n\nInitializing the website\n\nIn GitHub, create a new repository with the domain name that you would like for your website. For example, my repository name is ‘madeline-eppley’, so my website will be named ‘madeline-eppley.github.io’.\nIn GitHub Desktop, choose “Add Existing Repository” and paste the clone url. Alternatively, you can open the repository in GitHub, then select “Open with GitHub Desktop”. If you’re using the terminal, you can clone the repository with gh repo clone repo-name/repo-name.github.io.\nIf this was your first time linking a repository through GitHub Desktop, by default, GitHub Desktop will create a local folder named “GitHub” in your Documents folder (on a Mac) and place your repository there. I moved this folder into my regular user space, but you can store it anywhere you like. If you’ve already set up GitHub Desktop, your new repository will be linked in the previously created folder. Locate your local repository folder.\nIn your local R Studio, initialize a new Quarto project with “New Project” and select “Quarto Website”. Then, provide the directory name as your local repository folder. You should now see a basic index.qmd and _quarto.yml file in your directory.\nOpen your _quarto.yml file and add output-dir: docs directly under the type: website line. Save the edit.\nMake a test edit to the index.qmd file and then check “Render on Save”. This will open up a locally-hosted browser where you can preview your edits. If everything looks good, you can select “Render” and will have auto-generated .html files appear in a new /docs folder within the repository folder.\nTest the setup by committing these new files to GitHub through GitHub desktop. You should then see your new setup files on GitHub.\n\n\n\nRendering the Website\n\nGo to “Settings” in GitHub and scroll down to Pages. There, select Source “Deploy from a branch” and edit the branch so that it renders from the /docs folder in the main branch. The folder that you select should be where your .html files are stored, so after this point, do NOT move your .html files out of the /docs folder.\nAt this point, GitHub will begin automatically rendering your site. Under the “Actions” tab, you can check the build and deployment status.\nWhen it completes, you can return to Settings/Pages and see that your site will be live at ‘your-repo-title.github.io’. Now you can visit your site!\n\n\n\nEditing your Website Structure\nQuarto websites are designed to host structure within the _quarto.yml file. Here, you establish your website format, image folders, style, font design, header and footer, and order of the pages. You can check out my _quarto.yml file in my repo for inspiration!\nYour index.qmd file is your first “page” and is the home screen of your website. You can add new pages at any time by adding a new .qmd file in GitHub. Each time you add a new element of “structure” (eg. a new page), you need to update the _quarto.yml file to add this file.\nI typically edit my pages locally in RStudio, but it is also possible to edit them within GitHub. Standard R markdown formatting also applies to .qmd files. Wherever you edit, be sure to use GitHub desktop or git to push and pull your edits. Whenever you’re ready to publish your new edits, you need to return to your local RStudio and “Render” your edited file. This step is important because it re-generates your .html file, which is what is actually used to build the website. To save myself the hassle of remembering this step, I enable “Render on Save” for all of my pages within RStudio.\n\n\nAdding Images to your Website\nYou can add as many images to your Quarto website as you’d like! The first step is to set up your resources folder in your _quarto.yml file. Add resources: \"/img\" under the project: section at the top of the file. Next, add a high-quality (I suggest .png format) image to your /img folder and title it something intuitive (e.g. ‘profile_pic.png’). To add any image in-text, add ![](img/image_name.png){fig-alt=\"Add your caption here\"} to your .qmd file. There are several methods to adjust image size, caption font size, etc. that you can learn more about on the Quarto website.\n\n\nStyles, Icons, Fonts, and Colors\nComing soon!"

    "text": "Traditional metrics (e.g. citations) by which scientists are evaluated are deeply biased and perpetuate exclusionary networks (Davies et al. 2021). These traditional metrics of “success” directly influence career advancement opportunities, funding, awards, distinctions, tenure, and more. Altmetrics, or alternative metrics, (e.g. social media activity, news articles, interviews, etc.) offer an alternative method for quantitative evaluation. Altmetrics aid in recognizing that valuable scientific impact takes many forms, including equitable communication and translation of science to general audiences (Davies et al 2021). Personal websites positively drive altmetrics, meaning that scientists can directly benefit from having a strong online presence in social media, websites, or press (Peoples et al. 2016). Promoting and evaluating scientific work in diverse ways dismantles perpetuating bias and reliance on traditional citation metrics (Davies et al. 2021).\nBeyond this, personal academic websites offer the most complete opportunity to tell the story of yourself and your scientific work. By maintaining a personal website, you have control over keeping URLs, publications, email addresses, and CVs up-to-date, whereas an institutional page may not do so for you. You are also able to link research results, media and press, grant funding, and pictures all together in one place to engage in scientific storytelling with your audience. Funding bodies are now recognizing the value of this type of communication with general audiences, communities, and stakeholders, so having a personal website displays commitment to this broadening values system in science. It’s a no-brainer!\n\n\n\n\n\nI have used GitHub and Quarto to build this website! You need a GitHub account and some intermediate familiarity with coding in R to build your own. There is no cost to host your site, and you can host it on any custom domain that you may own. I have found that design functionality is extremely limited unless you are willing to custom-develop your own styles.css documents, which is time-consuming. Importantly, you can only host one GitHub pages site per account.\nI have an extensive tutorial on how to build your own Quarto website and host it on GitHub. Find it on my Coding page. To get started, Quarto also has a lot of information here.\n\n\n\nI have used Weebly to build my main personal website. I really enjoyed the ease of use and multitude of design options with Weebly. It is free to host your website with a ‘.weebly.com’ address, but you can also host on any custom domain that you may own. I purchased my custom domain through Weebly, and it was easy. There is a cost to remove banner ads at the bottom of your page, but they aren’t too distracting if you want to keep it free. No coding experience required, but it is helpful to know how to insert custom .html to embed code and links.\nYou can find my personal website on Weebly here.\n\n\n\nGoogle sites are free with a Google account and don’t require any coding experience to build. My lab has a google-hosted website that I edit regularly, and I find it easy with great version control to use as a review process before you publish. Your site is hosted on a ‘sites.google.com/site/yourwebsitenamehere address’, or you can use any custom domain that you may own. There is decent flexibility with design and they have pre-made templates that can get you started.\n\n\n\nI have not built websites with any other hosting service. I have peers that have successfully used Squarespace, Wix, and WordPress with mixed reviews. Most of these hosting services will require you to pay for a plan or to remove advertisements. You may also need to purchase a custom domain, but some, like WordPress, may allow you to host for free with a ‘.wordpress.com’ address.\n\n\n\n\nPersonal academic websites are a great tool for networking, sharing your research, and communicating science to general audiences. Think of your website as a digital repository of you as a scientist!\n\n\n\nAlways include links to publicly-accessible content wherever you can. Example: You were in a working group that published a paper. The working group was established out of an academic society where you all met. You should link (1) the academic society website AND (2) the DOI and direct link to an open-access paper OR (3) a link to directly download a .pdf of the paper.\nBetter yet, embed content directly into the site! Example: You went to an academic conference and presented a poster. You should (1) register your poster online through a service that makes it citable, like figshare to link the DOI, AND (2) embed it directly on your website by uploading it as a high-quality .pdf, .png, or using a service that can be integrated into your website, like SCRIBD.\nPresent all material without scientific jargon and include as many interactive elements, photos, and links as you can.Example: You developed an R Shiny app for visualizing an equation you use in your research. You should (1) link your R Shiny app to your research page and explain why the equation is important to a scientific audience, AND (2) link the R Shiny app in your teaching or outreach page as a science communication opportunity! When you’ve developed multipurpose products and tools, they are worth sharing with multiple audiences in distinct ways.\n\n\n\n\n\nCommunicating Science\nThis is your opportunity to show how your research and work is valuable beyond immediate scientific outcomes. You can include outreach or teaching products, media links to interviews, podcasts, or science writing, your blog, embed social media feeds, and lots of images of you and your science! Wherever possible, consider sharing teaching or outreach resources in ways that are reproducible.\nNetworking\nThis is your opportunity to communicate who YOU are as a scientist. A positionality statement about your identities and how they influence your work is a great place to start. Discussing your engagement with programs, projects, societies, and institutions is another way to create an immediate connection with someone who may also be a member. Posting your CV is a great way to showcase yourself and your achievements, especially for early-career researchers. Providing concrete ways to get in touch, either through social media, email, or a contact form is important.\nResearch\nThis is your opportunity to translate the research that you do to general scientific and non-scientific audiences. Consider that interactive elements, such as recorded oral presentations, videos, apps, photos, embedded posters, accessible .pdfs, and protocols are all going to garner more audience engagement than simple text on a page. A quick few sentences about your ongoing work can spark a conversation with someone in the science community who may be interested in what you’re working on next."

    "text": "I am mapping the prevalence of Polydora spp. worm blisters in eastern oyster shells to determine if populations across the range may adapt differently to parasitism. This tutorial provides basic guidance for taking high-quality images, identifying polydora worm blisters, and using ImageJ to calculate total area of infection.\n\n\n\n3-4 black beanbags, ideally with sand or small particles\nDSLR camera or digital camera with tripod attachment. An iPhone camera may work if it focuses on very close objects.\nCamera stand or tripod set-up that allows the camera to point directly down with no angle\nLevel table in a room with consistent, bright, indoor lighting - NO windows or natural light is ideal\nColor scale swatch card\nAn object of known invariable length (we use the length of a square in our color scale swatch card)\nA computer to run the freely-available ImageJ software\nA spreadsheet or app to collect data in\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVery helpful but not required materials\n\n\n\n\nA tablet or computer with touch screen and a stylus\nComputer mouse (instead of laptop trackpad)\nLarge external hard drive to store image backups. It is easy to generate several hundred images doing this protocol!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first step in the protocol is to take high-quality images of each shell. We photograph both valves together in one image. We also include a label with the ID number of the individual in the image for easy reference and a color scale card to ensure the color balance is consistent across images.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScale + Level\n\n\n\nIt’s crucial that all images of your study organism are taken at the same scale and are level. Any differences in the height of the object to the camera will translate into measurement differences in ImageJ. For this reason, use a level surface and do not vary the height of the tripod and camera. Keep all objects in the frame consistent in their distance to the camera lens across all images.\nTips: If possible, do not move the tripod setup until all imaging is complete to avoid micro-differences in camera adjustment. Use clay, beanbags, sandbags, etc. to support each object on a level plane. Do not change the height of the supportive materials (e.g. do not vary the number of beanbags).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttach camera to tripod setup. Focus the camera and take a trial image to test lighting.\nRemove the oyster shell and tag from the bag.\nStabilize the shells on top of black beanbags to ensure they sit parallel to the table and about ~5-6 inches below the camera lens.\nFocus the camera and take a few images with both shells, ID tag, and the color swatch in the frame. Make micro-adjustments in between images if necessary to ensure there is no glare on the shells.\n\n\n\nUpload the images from the camera into a folder on the computer that will use the ImageJ software.Label the folder based on population info (ID_Site_CollectionDate). Name each of the images a unique name (We use SG_XXXX_PD for seascape genomics, individual #, PolyDora).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCollecting Data\n\n\n\nWe collected our data using an app designed with AppSheet and linked to two Google Sheets - one for whole oyster measurements, and one for individual blister measurements. From this point on, if you are not using an app, record your data in whichever spreadsheet(s) you are collecting measurements in, we will refer to “app” as the data collection location.\n\n\n\nUpload the full color image of each individual into the app under the Image_valves_full_color field.\nInput TRUE or FALSE for Infection_status based on the individual. If there is at least one blister, the infection status is TRUE.\nUpload the full color image to ImageJ twice.\nConvert one of the images to 8-bit (Image-&gt;Type-&gt;8-bit) greyscale for color comparison.\nSet the measurement scale by using the linear selection tool to draw a diagonal line across a square on the color swatch. This is our scale object of known invariable length. Select “Analyze” then “set scale” and add the length of the diagonal line in the “known distance” text box and the unit in the “unit of length” text box.\n\n\n\nMeasure the area of each of the valves. Use the free draw selection tool to select the entire area of each value with the stylus, then press “m” to get the area. Enter the data into the app."
