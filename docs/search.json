    "text": "Hi! I’m Madeline, welcome to my website. I’m currently pursing a PhD in Marine and Environmental Science at Northeastern University in the Lotterhos Lab.\nFor my PhD, I am studying evolution of wild eastern oyster populations over space and time by integrating insights from population genomics approaches, environment and disease data, and historic museum DNA.\nIn the near future, I aim for my research to (1) delineate range-wide population structure of the eastern oyster, (2) identify genomic regions involved with immune response to parasite infection, and (3) highlight the utility of preserved museum DNA for temporally-informed marine disease genomics research.\nLonger term, I have a keen interest in continuing landscape genomics research with historic or ancient DNA specimens to better understand disease and parasite effects on host evolution over time. My ultimate goal is to promote scientific understanding and informed conservation of species threatened by disease (particularly in marine environments) with spatial and temporal ’omics approaches.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: column-page-inset\n\n\n::: {layout=“[[1, 1]]”}\n\n\n \n\n\n:::\n\n\nI hold a B.A. in Biology, magna cum laude, from Bard College at Simon’s Rock in Great Barrington, MA. I was awarded my B.A. in 2020 and graduated with Highest Honors on my senior thesis. For my senior thesis, I investigated the rate of shark and swordfish meat substitutions in New England markets (in prep manuscript available upon request).\n\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\nI made this website with Quarto and published with GitHub pages.

This workshop is meant to be run for 20-30 students during a ~45 minute time period, not including set up and clean up.\nIn the workshop, students will:\n(1) learn how to use scientific dissection tools (e.g. scalpel, tweezers, shucking knife) and dissect an eastern oyster, (2) identify anatomical structures and understand basic shellfish biology, (3) consider potential abiotic and biotic environmental drivers of phenotype divergence between geographically distant populations (e.g. intro to isolation-by-distance theory) and (4) brainstorm restoration approaches for the eastern oyster.\n\nThis workshop has been successfully run for several iterations!\n\nNortheastern University High School Marine Science Symposium, March 2023 (see the press release here)\nCOSA Marine Science Academy at Northeastern University Marine Science Center, August 2023\n\nNortheastern University BEACHES COSA\nLynn Public High Schools Outreach\nMarine Biology Club at Northeastern University"
