Hi! I'm Madeline, welcome to my website. I'm currently pursing a PhD in Marine and Environmental Science at [Northeastern University](https://cos.northeastern.edu/marinescience/) in the [Lotterhos Lab](https://sites.google.com/site/katielotterhos/home).

This site largely contains a digital repository of my work, including lab notebooks, code and outputs, and resource lists I've developed. You can find [my main website here](https://www.madeline-eppley.com).
