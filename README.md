Howdy, I'm Madeline, welcome to my Quarto website GitHub repository! I have extensively documented step-by-step protocols for [building your own Quarto website](https://madeline-eppley.github.io/coding.html#creating-a-quarto-website-with-github). My website uses basic Quarto templates and does not include any custom themes or styles. All of my code can be freely copied into your own GitHub repository.
