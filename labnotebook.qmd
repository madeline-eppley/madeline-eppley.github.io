## Lab Notebook

I am currently a PhD student conducting research on eastern oysters and their associated micro and macro-parasites. My lab notebook includes topics such as DNA plate extractions, PicoGreen Assays, gel electrophoresis, qPCR, and DNA isolation from tissues preserved in FFPE material.

## Eastern Oyster DNA Plate Extractions

Notes on this protocol coming soon! 

##### Challenge - Working with Small Tissues 

Notes on this protocol coming soon!

## PicoGreen Assays

Notes on this protocol coming soon!

## Gel Electrophoresis

We run 2% agarose gels with GelRed to visualize genomic DNA >3k base pairs. More on this soon!

## qPCR

I am currently developing protocols for this, check back soon!

## FFPE Tissue DNA Isolation

I am currently developing protocols for this, check back soon!
